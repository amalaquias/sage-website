# Overview

While some Sage features are open for public use, you'll need an approved account to perform tasks such as:

* Accessing protected data.
* Publishing apps to the ECR.
* Scheduling apps on nodes.

In this document, we'll walk though creating an account.

# Creating an account

1. Click on the __Portal__ button in the upper right corner.
2. Click on the __Sign In__ button in the upper right corner.
3. This will take you to the __Globus login page__ where you'll need to provide your organization credentials. If you do not see your organization, please see the "Didn't find your organization?" note at the bottom of the Globus login page.
4. Finally, if this is your first time signing in, you'll need to choose a username which will complete your account creation.

At this point, our team will need to review and approve your account before you'll have permission to perform certain tasks. If you your account is not approved within 72 hours or you have special requirements, please [Contact us](/docs/contact-us) so that we can help perform any account configuration.

# Next steps

Once your account is approved, you will have scheduling access and protected data browsing in the portal for nodes we've assigned to your account.

For CLI tools and SSH access to nodes, please go to __Portal → Your Account → Access Creds__ and follow the __Update SSH Public Keys__ and __Finish Setup for Node Access__ instructions.
